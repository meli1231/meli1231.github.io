      <h4>The first decade of the 17th century saw a continuation of many Elizabethan trends,<br>
         with small changes in skirt length, sleeve shape, and collar types 
         slowly being introduced.</h4>

                    <h6>Just as the reign of Queen Elizabeth I would last into the first years of the <br>
                        seventeenth century, fashion trends of  the 1590s would also endure <br> into the new 
                         century. Daniel Delis Hill confirms this in The History of World Costume and Fashion 
                          (2011),  writing that “at the beginning of the <br> seventeenth century, women’s clothing 
                           retained many of the contours <br> and design elements from the end of the  previous century” (406).</h6>
                        
                           <h6> “Elizabethan influence lasted until well after the death of the <br> Queen in 1603. 
                            While some forms were inspired by the Continent… drum-farthingales and starched fan 
                             collars for women the volume of the silhouette, <br> the richness and stiffness of 
                              materials and the heavily loaded decoration <br> kept the character of sixteenth-century modes. <br>
                               Until about 1620, women still wore embroidered jackets.”</h6>

                        <h6>The foundation garment for all dress was the chemise, atop which women <br> now wore 
                             stays to create the desirable silhouette of the time. We’re given a <br> rare peek at early 
                              seventeenth-century stays in the portrait of Elizabeth <br> Vernon, Countess of Southampton 
                            , who is shown dressing in a rather daringly informal portrait. As Anna Reynolds 
                                remarks in In Fine Style (2013): <br><br><br> “The countess reveals her long-waisted pink stays beneath 
                                 her unpinned <br> waistcoat.” Indeed dresses of this period relied heavily on pinning to 
                                  stay together; on Elizabeth’s dressing table, a cushion full of pins to aid in dressing is visible.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Heavily embroidered bodices, or waistcoats in Vernon’s case, were typical <br> of the period, with the 
                                  English particularly specializing in floral embroidered pieces. <br> A very fine surviving example from 
                                  around 1600 in the Kyoto Costume Institute’s collection features “roses, peas & beans, 
                                  forget-me-nots, tulips, irises, carnations, and bellflowers, … birds, caterpillars, snails, spiders, 
                                  and snakes.” Known as the Devereux Bodice, it is said to have been given to Queen Elizabeth as a gift
                                   as part of an unsuccessful plea for clemency by the mother of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (Kyoto).</h6>

      <h4>Rococo fashion was all the rage in the 1740s along with the robe à la française worn as <br>
         the primary gown for both formal and informal occasions. At the same time, men’s fashion remained <br>
          just as full as the 1730s, and French and English fashion represented two ends of a spectrum.</h4>

                    <h6>The robe à la française, or sack as it was known in <br> England, was the standard garment 
                      for women, for both day and evening. Established <br> as the dominant form of female
                       dress in the 1730s, the gown changed minimally from that decade <br> until the 1770s, when it was 
                       replaced by other, more informal styles. The bodice front, cut separately <br> at the waist since 
                       the 1740s, fitted tightly to the torso, and lacing at the back <br> of the linen lining allowed the
                        wearer to pull the dress in closely, while its characteristic <br> box pleats extended across the
                         upper back, falling to a slight hem. <br> A triangular stomacher of matching woven
                          or embroidered fabric, or decorated with ribbon bows in <br> a form known as an échelle, or ladder,
                           filled in the front opening of the gown.

                      Depending on the textiles that ranged from monochromatic <br> taffetas, satins, and damasks to vividly
                       colored brocaded silks with self-figured grounds and the size of the <br> pannier, the robe à la 
                       française/sack was worn as an informal garment <br> in the morning and afternoon and a highly formal
                        gown in the evening .</h6>

                        <h6>In a letter written from London in 1751, Lady Jane Coke referred to the popularity <br>
                           of this type of gown:

                          “You ask me whether sacks are generally worn; I am so partial to ‘em that I have nothing <br>
                           else—a sack and an apron, with a very small hoop, when I am undressed, and the whole ones <br>
                            when I am to be set out.” (quoted in Buck 26-27)
                          <br><br>
                          Although Lady Coke’s apron signaled informality—or “undress”—this would not have been <br>
                           the plain, hardwearing linen or cotton version worn by working-class women and female <br>
                            servants. Silk and fine, embroidered mull aprons were fashionable accessories for affluent <br>
                             women, especially in England. More informal still was the hip-length jacket <br>
                              bodice, or caraco—a truncated version of the sack—and petticoat combination worn by Mrs. <br>
                               Andrews in a double portrait with her husband by Thomas Gainsborough dating to 1750. <br>
                                Until the last quarter of the century when it became stylish everyday wear, this ensemble, <br>
                                 based on that of working-class women, was primarily adopted for indoors or for country <br>
                                  pursuits. <br>

                                    <h6>he fashionable silhouette of the 1850s was defined by a small <br> waist, drooping shoulders, 
                                       and a voluminous skirt that <br> steadily grew in size through the decade. By far, the most <br>
                                      important characteristic of 1850s <br> womenswear was the dome-shaped skirt with its fullness <br>
                                      evenly distributed (Severa 96). The large skirt was supported underneath by multiple petticoats, <br>
                                      sometimes up to seven at once (Fig. 1). At least one of these petticoats would typically be a <br>
                                      crinoline, a type of petticoat that was stiffened with horsehair. In 1856, the cage crinoline, <br>
                                      a device consisting of a series of concentric steel hoops, was introduced; it provided immediate <br>
                                      relief from the multiple heavy and cumbersome petticoats (Bruna 178-179). It allowed skirts to <br>
                                      reach new proportions, especially between 1858 and 1862 (Thieme 41). Relatively inexpensive, <br>
                                      the cage crinoline was worn at all levels of society (Foster 14). Fashion historian C. Willett <br>

                                          During the first years of the 1850s, the style of the late 1840s <br>
                                          was still seen, marked by the long torso stiffened with constricting <br>
                                          corsets (Fig. 2). But by 1853, the long, dropped waistline of the 1840s <br>
                                          rose to its natural position, and as a result, the emphasis on tight-lacing <br>
                                          lessened as the corset shortened and flared. <br><br><br>
                                          Daytime dresses featured high necklines, often completed with <br>
                                          a wide white collar, long sleeves, and most frequently, a straight <br>
                                          or curved waistline (Severa 175). A common bodice decoration was the <br>
                                          V-shaped “bretelles” that spread from the center waist to the outer <br>
                                          edges of the dropped shoulders, usually finished in trim. <br>
                                          The narrow fitted sleeve of the 1840s began to loosen at the end of <br>
                                          the decade, and in the 1850s, sleeves became wide and open, expanding <br>
                                          from either the shoulder or the elbow. These sweeping “pagoda” sleeves 
                                          were worn with removable white undersleeves called engageantes that 
                                          puffed and closed at the wrist. Reaching the 
                                          widest point from 1857 to 1860, the pagoda sleeve was often trimmed 
                                          with bows and fringed epaulettes (Foster 83; Thieme 37). Indeed, 
                                          passementerie trims such as fringe, tassels, ribbons, braids, and 
                                          cords were very much in vogue during the 1850s for use on both the 
                                          bodice and skirt.
